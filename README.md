Description of the Master's Programme

The main aim of the Master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics from the UOC and UB is to train specialists in the fields of bioinformatics and biostatistics, meeting the growing demand for these professionals from companies, institutions, and universities.

Disciplines such as molecular biology, medicine, veterinary science, and agronomy are generating vast amounts of data. To fully exploit these omics data and make advances in these fields, experts in managing, analysing, and interpreting this data are needed: professionals in bioinformatics, genomics, computational biology, or biocomputation.

The Master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics from the UOC and UB offers a profile particularly suited to current needs, with balanced content in bioinformatics and biostatistics, aimed at acquiring skills in data management, artificial intelligence, modelling, and statistical analysis of bioinformatic problems.

To enrol in the Master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, it is advisable to have completed any of the following studies:

- Computer Engineering or Telecommunications Engineering (degree, engineering, technical engineering).
- Degree, engineering, technical engineering, degree, or diploma in the Area of Engineering and Architecture.
- Degree, degree, or diploma in the Area of Sciences. For example, Mathematics or Statistics.
- Degree, degree, or diploma in the Area of Health Sciences. For example, Biology, Medicine, Pharmacy, or Veterinary.

Students undertake mandatory training that enables them to acquire the foundations of bioinformatics and biostatistics knowledge and to learn advanced handling of specialised software in this field.

Moreover, the master's offers the flexibility and elective options necessary for students to specialise in areas of greatest interest to them. Elective subjects include topics such as molecular and structural biology, design and analysis of experiments, survival analysis or multivariate analysis, and machine learning or data science, as well as the opportunity to undertake internships in companies.

The Master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and the University of Barcelona leads to an official degree recognised by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport in the Royal Decree 1393/2007, dated October 29, published in the BOE no. 34-2013 on 02/08/2013.
